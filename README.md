# RULE: Reliable Multimodal RAG for Factuality in Medical Vision Language Models

*We tackle the challenge of improving factual accuracy in Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs) using our novel approach, RULE. Despite their promise, Med-LVLMs often generate responses misaligned with established medical facts. RULE addresses this with two key strategies: 1) Calibrated selection of retrieved contexts to control factuality risk. 2) Fine-tuning models using a preference dataset to balance reliance on inherent knowledge and retrieved contexts. Our method achieves a 20.8% improvement in factual accuracy across three medical VQA datasets.*

## üåüRequirements
1. Clone this repository and navigate to RULE folder
```bash
https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/RULE.git
cd RULE
```

2. Install Package: Create conda environment

```Shell
conda create -n RULE python=3.10 -y
conda activate RULE
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
pip install trl
```

## üì¶Preparation
- Download the model checkpoint [LLaVA-Med-1.5](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/llava-med-v1.5-mistral-7b) from huggingface.
- Download the [test data and annotations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zky11235/test_data) under `data/`.
- Download the [model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/zky11235/dpo_checkpoints) after DPO training under `checkpoints/`.

## üöÄTraining
- The training code of Direct Preference Optimization is at `llava/train/train_dpo.py`. 
- The relevant script can be found at `scripts/run_dpo.sh`


## üõ†Ô∏èInference

- For test dataset inference, you need to specify the following arguments.
```python
python llava/eval/model_vqa_{dataset}.py \
    --model-base 'path/to/llava-med-1.5' \
    --model-path 'path/to/lora_weights' \
    --question-file 'path/to/question_file.json' \
    --image-folder 'path/to/test_images' \
    --answers-file 'path/to/output_file.json'
```
- The written script is at `scripts/inference.sh`. Before that, you need to set the correct path of data and checkpoints in your script.
