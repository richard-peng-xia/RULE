Findings: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright\n position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding\n similar chest examination of ___.\n \n Heart size is not enlarged.  No configurational abnormality is present.  The\n entire thoracic aorta is rather widened and elongated and shows advanced\n calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch.  The pulmonary\n vasculature is not congested.  However, there is a markedly irregular\n distribution of the peripheral pulmonary vasculature characterized by a local\n streaky scar densities and localized areas of increased translucencies.  This\n finding in conjunction with the generally low positioned and flattened\n diaphragms is typical for COPD.  Also noted is that the patient has a rather\n deep chest diameter as identified on the lateral view including an accentuated\n kyphotic curvature of the thoracic spine.  In addition, one can identify\n multiple well-demarcated densities partially of calcium density most likely\n representing mediastinal nodes.  When comparison is made with the next\n preceding chest examination of ___, the described changes\n existed already at that time, thus findings are grossly stable.  Comparison of\n the frontal views, however, identifies a small density in the left mid lung\n zone overlying the crossing between the posterior portion of the sixth left\n rib and that of the anterior portion of the fourth left ribs.  This very small\n less than 0.5 cm diameter density cannot be identified on the old film and\n thus it is recommended to be followed up in a few weeks.

Heart size is\n unchanged and the same holds for the appearance of the thoracic aorta. \n Previously described right-sided perihilar mass, grossly unchanged. Within\n this density one can identify the metallic structures of the stent, which has\n been placed in the right-sided main bronchus partially seen to occupy portions\n of the carina.  There is no evidence of any airway obstruction through the\n stent.  There is no evidence of new atelectasis distal to the stent which\n ventilates the area of the right lower and middle lobes.  Comparison of the\n frontal views; however, suggests new local parenchymal density in the central\n portion of the right middle lobe as can be identified also on the lateral\n view.  The previously identified increased interstitial markings in the left\n upper lobe persist and may have increased slightly.  They are believed to\n represent interstitial carcinomatosis.  The lateral and posterior pleural\n sinuses remain free, thus there is no evidence of significant pleural\n effusion.
