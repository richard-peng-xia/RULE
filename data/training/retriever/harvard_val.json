PERSON's examination of vitreous cell and vitreoretinal traction of unclear etiology, for which we discussed uveitis referral for further evaluation, particularly in light of his prior episode of aseptic meningitis and thyroiditis. given the subtle accompanying right optic neuropathy noted on examination, addition of contrast-enhanced mri of the orbits to his planned mri of the brain would be informative in excluding an alternate process. i will plan to see mr.
