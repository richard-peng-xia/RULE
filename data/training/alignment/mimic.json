Findings: There is a persistent opacity at the left base, similar to the prior exam.  This likely represents a pneumonia, and less likely reexpansion edema given that it has now persisted for two days. There is a small residual left pleural effusion, which is not significantly changed since one day ago. Overall, the volume of fluid is significantly decreased since the patient's initial presentation. There is a new tiny left apical pneumothorax. The right lung is clear.
