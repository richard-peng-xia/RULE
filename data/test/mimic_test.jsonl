Findings: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with the patient in\n upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next\n preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___.  Previously\n described heart size, mediastinal structures, and permanent pacer with dual\n electrode system remain unchanged.  The same holds also with the previously\n described loculated pleural effusion that blunts the left-sided lateral\n pleural sinus.  Parenchymal densities in the posterior portion of the left\n lower lobe remain unchanged as they present on the lateral view.  The only\n significant difference is the appearance of substantial amount of\n subdiaphragmatic air which was not found on the preceding chest examination. \n Telephone contact with referring physician, ___. ___, explained this\n finding as the patient is daily abdominal dialysis."}
